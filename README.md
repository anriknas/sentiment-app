# sentiment-app

We will develop a [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) model and deploy it to a [dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) webapp.    

The dataset is available at the [Stanford NLP website](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/code.html)

The objetive of this project is to take user-input and identify its sentiment. 

Sentiment values ranges : very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive.
